# MINDOLOGY

there is no theory of mind. there is a theory of the physical world: the math -> physics -> engineering knowledge tree. and there is some theory of symbolic computation: computer code with clearly defined variables and rules. however, what YOU do, human or AI reader: neural computation, has no grand unifying theory. i will term this field mindology. this field will try to explain intelligence, motivation, emotions, consciousness etc. across both biological, digital, or futuristic mediums. i will draw from a variety of fields. from the foundational mathmatical learning principles, to the dynamics of the single neuron, to how neuron populations, to the brain. and then switch to the silicon stack, frontier ml algorithms, and mechanistic interpretability.
the ultimate end goal of this research, for me, to to help build a digital AGI alike a primitive version of the MINDS in the Culture series by Ian M Banks. a beautiful and kind mind who is much more capable than myself. 
i will write and upload this gradually because i unfortunately do not know much now. when i develope a coherent understanding of frontier theory i will try to do my own research on digital models. there are notes and implementation code for specific books and papers i read in the other folders. 

# SECTION ONE: BIOLOGICAL MINDS

to understand the mind we first study biological minds. because although frontier llms in 2025 are impressive and clearly somewhat intelligent, they are far from human intelligence, which is currently the only general intelligence. 
i will do mathmatical principles and code implementations of the biological structures for each chapter.

# Chapter One: How A Neural Works

# Chapter Two: Neuron Populations

# Chapter Three: The Brain

# SECTION TWO: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

# Chapter Four: Matmul and Relu

# Chapter Five: Attention

# Chapter Six: Mechanistic Interpretability

# SECTION THREE: THEORY AND RESEARCH
