# how the mind works
there is no existing clean overarching theory of the minds that includes intelligence, motivation, emotion, consciousness, in digital AI, in humans, in animals, in whatever future computational mediums. this book will try to create one based on existing and original research.

# intelligence
the mind, the brain, is created by evolution. the strictly necessarily part to survive, i will call intelligence. note that is does not include consciousness. an ai could be intelligent without being conscious.  
some terms.  
world: the entire universe, but particularly the set you care about  
resource: the things you can move and allocate. most directly your body, but also machinery or social relationships.  
action: some way of allocating resources. i.e. moving an arm, pressing a button  
action space: all possible actions given current resources  
sensation: what information the mind has access to from the world. for example, light hits the eyes, sound hits the ears, etc.  
motivation / aesthetics: some way the desired most optimal world looks like  
optimal action: among all actions in action space, the action that makes the world into one that fits the aesthetics the most  
intelligence: the ability, through computation, to find the optimal action  
representation: internal objects corresponding to objects in the world and their properties  
abstraction: representation exists at some abstraction level from atoms of the world to internal higher order concepts
simulation: a internal experiment done on representations on what would happen to the world given an action taken  
learning: compressing the real world's objects in past experiences into representations that can be used in future simulations


cart example: say there is a cart and its motivation is to pick up a cargo. the world is the cart's position, the cargo's position, whether the cargo is picked up, any walls etc. resources is itself, including it's motors leading to it's wheels, it's steering wheel that can turn it's wheels. basically it can "drive" itself. action space is steering angle and motor turn speed. optimal action is the one that goes towards the cargo without crashing into walls in the shortest path possible. intelligence is the ability to take in, maybe through sensors, the world, and then do some computation, maybe some planning, and then picking the correct path and generating the correct action.  


# representations and transformations
intelligence functions by manipulating inner representations through transformations. in coding terminology this is states and functions. in actual biology this is neural signals and neural weights. in AI this is intermediate tensors and model parameters (doing matmuls to these tensors)

# why matmuls why relus
matmul as double projection

# what is a neuron doing?

# what is a group of neurons doing? 

# what is the neocortex doing?

# what is the old brain doing? 

# free energy minimization
